## Some text for the about section
<p>While self-study is an essential part of learning to make software but interacting with others is equally if not more important. When you learn by yourself you are alone with your own version of how to learn or taking advice (sometimes good) online from people who have never met you. Further more, coding is a social and collaborative activity in which you work with other developers as well as members of QA, Project Management and much more.</p>
<h3>It's Called "Making Software"</h3>
<p>'Learning to code' is all the rage but developers aren't hired to write code. Employers & clients need software they can deploy and that requires many skills in addition to coding, both technical and social.</p>
> Making software is a social activity. There is a long list of people a developer must interact with: other developers, QA, Project Management
> Mentorship
> Interacting with others
> Humans are social beings and learning is thereby a social activity
> When leaning in isolation you are isolated from the ideas and guidance of other people

It's making software, not coding
The phrase 'learning to code' and 'coding' is commonly used for the activity of makeing software, but don't be mistaken, creating software takes a lot more than coding and as a software developer you need to do much more than just code.
